- Bulk download and scanning of JS files for sensitive keys, secrets, and endpoints
- Detects common P1 bug bounty vulnerabilities such as API keys, tokens, hardcoded passwords, and more
- Fancy terminal UI with ASCII art logo and loading animations
- JSON and console report generation
- Extensible plugin system for custom scanning rules

## Usage
